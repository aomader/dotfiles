        Build with python support

        Requires:
            pep8

    gpg-agent
    ---------
    
    To use the gpg-agent with your ssh keys you need to do an initial "ssh-add"
    which stores your key fingerprint in the ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol file so you
    may use the gpg-agent with your ssh keys.
